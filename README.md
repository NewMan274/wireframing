# 📐 Wireframing

## 📝 What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual guide that represents the structure, layout, and functionality of a digital interface, such as a website or mobile app. It acts as a blueprint for the design, showing the placement of key elements like headers, content areas, navigation menus, and buttons without focusing on visual style or detailed content.

Wireframes are typically created in grayscale using basic shapes and lines to prioritize content hierarchy, user flow, and usability.

## 🚀 Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing is a crucial step in the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design process for several reasons:

- **Clarity of Structure:** Helps stakeholders and team members visualize the basic layout before investing time in high-fidelity design or development.
- **User-Centered Design:** Focuses on how users interact with content, improving usability and navigation flow.
- **Faster Iteration:** Allows quick adjustments to structure and flow based on feedback.
- **Better Communication:** Serves as a communication tool between designers, developers, and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is aligned before development begins.

## ✅ When to Use Wireframes

Wireframes are typically used during the early planning and design phases of a project. They are especially helpful when:

- Defining feature requirements
- Planning layouts for different screen sizes (responsive design)
- Preparing for prototyping and UI design
- Collaborating across cross-functional teams
